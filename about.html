<p>
  I did my MS in Medical Microiology and Ph.D. in Experimental Medicine and
  Biotechnology, which I earned a decade back from India. Presently, I am
  working as a Prinicipal Data Scientist in Genomics and Clinical Science field.
  I want to explore Clinical Data Science in-depth, especially in cancer and
  cardiology, and apply Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for
  diagnosis and drug discovery. To understand the technical part, I decided to
  pursue MS in Data Science.

  In my free time I like photography, scientific writing, traveling, and
  cooking.
