<p>
  I did my MS in Biosciences and a Ph.D. in Biotechnology, which I earned a
  decade back. Presently, I am working as a Data Scientist in Genomics and
  Clinical Science. I want to explore Clinical Data Science in-depth, especially
  in cancer and cardiology, and apply Machine Learning and Artificial
  Intelligence for diagnosis and drug discovery. To understand the technical
  part, I decided to pursue MS in Data Science. I like photography, scientific
  writing, traveling, and cooking.
