### [Project 1 Walmart Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/nitinmahajan20/Walmart_Sales_Forecasting)

Background:
Sales Forecasting is the process of using a company’s sales records over the past few years to predict the short-term or long-term sales performance of the company in the future. Sales forecasting is a globally conducted corporate practice where number of objectives are identified, action-plans are chalked out as well as budgets and resources are allotted to them. Business Sales Executives often find themselves scrambling for answers when it comes to sales forecasting during business reviews. The Sales Forecast Model will help sales executives to find such answers upfront and be ready with numbers and predictions to share with leaderships team.

Problem Statement:
The goal of this analysis is to predict future sales for the Walmart stores based on the varying features and events.
• Build the Machine Learning model that would learn from past records, events and predict the accurate outcomes.
• Predict the Sales forecast for Store and its departments on specific week of the year considering if it is before holiday or after holiday.

Modeling:
These ML algorithms are used to train the model and evaluated using Weighted mean absolute error. The model with lowest RMSE score and best accuracy score is baselined. Following are the list of ML algorithms are used to train the model –

- KNN Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost Regressor)
- ARIMA - Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average
